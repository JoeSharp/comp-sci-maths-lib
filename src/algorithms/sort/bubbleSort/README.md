# Bubble Sort

This folder contains various implementations of the Bubble Sort Algorithm.

For a full description of this algorithm together with pseudocode visit [Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_search_bubble)

# Test

# basic.js

This file contains a plain JavaScript implementation of the Bubble Sort using nested for loops.

# basicStrings.ts

This file contains a typescript version of the Bubble Sort, hardcoded for strings

# templated.ts

This file contains a typescript version of the Bubble Sort

- using templating to allow any data type
- Allows for a custom comparison function to allow complex arrays to be sorted.

# monitored.ts

This file contains a completely generic form of the sort with templating type safety, and the ability to specific custom functions for:

- Comparing
- Swapping
- Observing Stages

This is the implementation used by the comp-sci-maths-ui project to show the inner workings visually.
