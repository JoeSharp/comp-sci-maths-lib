# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of all the key Sorting Algorithms that you must be familiar with.

Each folder contains a series of files

* basic.js - A vanilla JavaScript implementation of the algorithm
* stringSort.ts - A basic TypeScript implementation of the algorithm written specifically to sort strings
* genericSort.ts - A templated version of the sorting algorithm in TypeScript, allowing custom comparators for sorting lists of any type
* monitoredSort.ts - A highly customisable TypeScript implementation that allows the caller to monitor various stages of the operation.

## Algorithms

The algorithms that have been implemented are

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

Full descriptions of these together with Pseudocode can be found on [Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/)
